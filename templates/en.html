            Have you ever dreamed of a system that boots in less than few seconds from
            power-on to working GUI? About applications that start instantly, immediately
            after clicking an icon, without annoying hourglass pointers?
            This speed is achieved since the core parts of <b>KolibriOS</b>
            (kernel and drivers) are written entirely in
            <a href="http://www.flatassembler.net" target="_blank">FASM</a>
            assembly language!
            Try <b>KolibriOS</b> and compare it with such heavyweights as Windows and Linux.

            <b>KolibriOS</b> has forked off from MenuetOS in 2004, and is run under
            independent development since then.
